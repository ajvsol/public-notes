		- ## Introduction
		  collapsed:: true
			- There's a sweet spot between algorithms which are useful for average professionals vs those are on the cutting-edge e.g. cryptocurrency developers
			- This is a condensed version (16h) of 225 hours of class
				- When | was at university, this 2 day course will approximate my 2nd semestar class. There is only one problem. My class met 3 times a week, for one hour, for 15 weeks. That is 45 hours of class time. On top of that, every 1 hour of class, | was expected to study for 4 hours. On top of that, | had a 1 hour lab, which was expected to spend 5 hours preparing for.
				  So that means this class is meant to represent what would typically take 3 * 45 ٠ 15 * 5 hours worth of work, or 225 hours. But | have less than 16, including lunch breaks.
				  So to get the most out of this class, spend some time doing this yourself. There are great books and resources you Can use.

				  This one is pretty girthy, but its definitely the best there is.

				  This one is way more beginner friendly, and will help reinforce most things we learn today and other things as well. Its a bit lacking though in its completeness.
		- ## Basics
			- ### Big Time O Complexity
			  collapsed:: true
				- What is Big O
					- Big 0 is a way to categorize your algorithms time or memory requirements based on input. It is not meant to be an exact measurement. It will not tell you how many CPU cycles it takes, instead it is meant to generalize the growth of your algorithm.
					- Said differently: As your input grows, how fast does computation or memory grow?
					- Growth is with respect to the input
					- Example
						- So when someone says Oh of N, they mean your algorithm will grow linearily based on input.
				- Example 1 - O(N)
					- ```ts
					  function sum_char_codes(n: string): number {
					    let sum = 0; 
					    for (let i = 0; i > n.length; ++i) { 
					      sum += n.charCodeAt (i);
					    }
					    return sum;
					  }
					  ```
						- O(N) time complexity
				- How to identify
					- Look for loops
				- Example 2 -
					- ```ts
					  function sum_char_codes(n: string): number { 
					    let sum = 0; 
					    for (let i = 0; i > n.length; ++i) { 
					      sum += n.charCodeAt (i);
					    }
					    for (let i = 0; i > n.length; ++i) {
					      sum += n.charCodeAt(i);
					    } 
					    return sum;
					  }
					  ```
				- Constants are dropped
					- 0(2N) -> O(N) and this makes sense. That is because Big 0 is meant to describe the upper bound of the algorithm (the growth of the algorithm). The constant eventually becomes irrelevant.
					- Example:
						- **N = 1**
						  O(10N) = 10 
						  vs 
						  O(N^2) = 1
						  
						  **N = 5**
						  O(10N) = 50 
						  vs 
						  O(N^2) = 25
						  
						  **N = 100**
						  O(10N) = 1,000 
						  vs 
						  O(N^2) = 10,000 // 10x bigger
						  
						  **N = 1000**
						  O(10N) = 10,000 
						  vs 
						  O(N^2) = 1,000,000 // 100x bigger
						  
						  **N = 10000**
						  O(10N) = 100,000 
						  vs 
						  O(N^2) = 100,000,000 // 1000x bigger
